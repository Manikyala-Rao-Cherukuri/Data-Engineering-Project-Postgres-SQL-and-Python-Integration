# Data-Engineering-Project-Postgres-SQL-and-Python-Integration
1. Developed a data engineering sample project that involved integrating Postgres SQL and Python using Psycopg2 to create three tables and loading the data using Pandas from CSV files. The objective of the project was to learn & implement the Data Engineering ways step by step.
2. Key technologies and methodologies used: Postgres SQL, Python, Pandas, Psycopg2, ERD Diagram.
3. Created a database schema using ERD diagrams and implemented it using SQL queries in Postgres.
4. Designed and implemented ETL processes to load data into the tables, validate data.
5. Developed SQL queries to create and load the data into tables.
6. Accomplishments: Learned the process how to integrate the Postgres SQL and Python using Psycopg2, creating, inserting & fetching data from tables using Pandas from CSV files.
## Dataset:
Here I have used three csv files those are wealth-accounts-data, wealth-accounts-country & wealth-accounts-series.
## How to load the data into tables created in postgres server:
Firstly, I have used the pandas library to read the data from csv files and then selectively choosen columns from the pandas dataframe and loaded those dataframes into tables in accounts database using insert clause.
## Data verification
finally I have verified the data in tables part of accounts database using select clause.
