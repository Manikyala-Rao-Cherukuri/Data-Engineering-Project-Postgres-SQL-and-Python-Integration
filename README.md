# Data-Engineering-Project-Postgres-SQL-and-Python-Integration
1. Developed a data engineering project that involved integrating Postgres SQL and Python using Psycopg2 to create three tables and loading the data using Pandas from CSV files. The objective of the project was to analyze and manipulate data to derive insights for business decisions.
2. Key technologies and methodologies used: Postgres SQL, Python, Pandas, Psycopg2, ERD Diagram.
3. Created a database schema using ERD diagrams and implemented it using SQL queries in Postgres.
4. Designed and implemented ETL processes to load data into the tables, validate data.
5. Developed custom SQL queries to create and load the data into tables.
6. Accomplishments: Learned the process how to integrate the Postgres SQL and Python using Psycopg2 to create three tables and loading the data using Pandas from CSV files.
